This is a dummy longin/signup page using Semantic-UI-React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Nice to remember:
* Install `npm install semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css --save`
* `import "semantic-ui-css/semantic.css";` to get the styling
* [https://react.semantic-ui.com/](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) to get the props for each component
* Grid component for responsive design
